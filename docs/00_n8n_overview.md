# n8n Overview

## What is n8n?

n8n is a powerful, fair-code, and extendable workflow automation tool. It enables users to connect various applications and services to automate complex processes and tasks. n8n can be self-hosted or used via its cloud offering.

It provides a visual workflow designer, allowing users to build workflows by connecting nodes. While it emphasizes a visual, low-code approach, it also supports custom code (e.g., JavaScript) for more advanced logic and transformations, offering a blend of simplicity and power.

The n8n platform is designed to be highly flexible, supporting a wide range of integrations (nodes) for popular apps and services, as well as generic nodes for tasks like HTTP requests, data transformation, and scheduling.

## Core Philosophy

-   **Extendibility**: n8n allows users to create their own custom nodes and integrations.
-   **Fair-Code Licensing**: Offers a source-available model that provides many of the freedoms of open-source while ensuring the project's sustainability.
-   **Community-Driven**: Has a strong community contributing nodes, workflows, and support.
-   **Data Control**: Self-hosting options give users full control over their data and infrastructure.

## Why Use n8n?

-   **Automate Repetitive Tasks**: Free up time by automating manual processes across different applications.
-   **Integrate Disparate Systems**: Connect APIs and services that don't natively talk to each other.
-   **Build Complex Workflows**: Design sophisticated automation sequences with conditional logic, error handling, and data transformations.
-   **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly build and test automation ideas.
-   **AI-Powered Automation**: n8n is increasingly incorporating AI capabilities to build smarter and more adaptive workflows.

This overview provides a foundational understanding for an AI agent to grasp what n8n is and its primary purpose. The subsequent documents will delve into specific components and concepts.
