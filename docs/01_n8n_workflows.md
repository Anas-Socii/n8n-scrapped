# n8n Workflows

## What is a Workflow?

In n8n, a workflow is the core concept representing an automated process. It's a sequence of connected **nodes** that pass data between them to perform a series of actions. Think of it as a visual flowchart for your automation.

Workflows are designed in the n8n visual editor by dragging, dropping, and configuring nodes.

## Key Characteristics of Workflows:

-   **Trigger-based or Manual**: Workflows can be initiated by a **trigger node** (e.g., a schedule, a webhook, an event in an app) or started manually from the n8n editor.
-   **Data Flow**: Data typically flows from left to right, from one node to the next. Each node processes the input data it receives and passes its output to the next connected node(s).
-   **Execution Modes**:
    -   **Manual Execution**: Running a workflow directly from the editor, usually for testing and development.
    -   **Production Execution**: Activated workflows that run automatically based on their trigger.
-   **Active vs. Inactive**: A workflow must be "active" to run automatically in production. Inactive workflows can only be run manually.
-   **Version Control**: n8n keeps a history of workflow changes, allowing users to revert to previous versions.
-   **Error Handling**: Workflows can include error handling mechanisms to manage issues that might arise during execution.

## Workflow Structure (Conceptual):

1.  **Trigger Node(s)**: The starting point(s) of a workflow. A workflow can have one or more trigger nodes.
    *   Examples: Schedule, Webhook, On App Event (e.g., new email, new form submission).
2.  **Action Nodes**: Perform specific tasks like sending an email, updating a database, calling an API, transforming data, etc.
3.  **Logic Nodes**: Control the flow of execution, such as `If` nodes for conditional logic, `Switch` nodes for multi-path routing, or `Merge` nodes to combine data from different branches.
4.  **Data Transformation Nodes**: Nodes like `Set`, `Edit Fields`, or `Function` (for custom JavaScript code) are used to manipulate and restructure data as it flows through the workflow.
5.  **Connections**: Lines drawn between nodes that define the path of data and execution. Each connection typically links an output of one node to an input of another.

## Workflow Data:

-   **JSON-based**: Data within n8n workflows is primarily handled as JSON objects. Each node receives a list of JSON items as input and produces a list of JSON items as output.
-   **Expressions**: n8n uses expressions (often JavaScript-like syntax, e.g., `{{ $json.propertyName }}`) to access and manipulate data from previous nodes.
-   **Data from Previous Nodes**: Nodes can access data generated by any preceding node in the flow, not just the immediately previous one. This is managed through references like `$input`, `$json`, `$item`, `$items()`, `$node`, etc.

## Exporting and Importing Workflows:

-   Workflows can be exported from n8n as JSON files. This JSON file contains the entire definition of the workflow, including all nodes, their configurations, parameters, and connections.
-   These JSON files can be imported into the same or different n8n instances, facilitating sharing and backup of workflows. Understanding this JSON structure is key for programmatically analyzing n8n workflows. (This will be detailed in a separate document).

This document provides an AI agent with a solid understanding of what n8n workflows are, their structure, and how they operate.
