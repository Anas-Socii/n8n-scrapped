# XML to Dropbox Converter

## Summary
Fetches XML data from a URL, converts it to JSON, modifies its content, converts it back to XML, and uploads the result to Dropbox.

## Description
This workflow demonstrates how to automate the transformation and storage of XML data. It retrieves XML from an external source, converts it to JSON for manipulation, modifies the title field, converts the updated structure back to XML, and uploads the new XML file to Dropbox. This is useful for data integration, transformation, and archiving tasks.

## Input Triggers
- HTTP Request (fetches XML from an external URL)

## Output
- Modified XML file uploaded to Dropbox

## Nodes Involved
- **HTTP Request**: Fetches XML data from a specified URL.
- **XML (To JSON)**: Converts XML to JSON for manipulation.
- **Set**: Modifies the JSON structure (e.g., changes the title).
- **XML (To XML)**: Converts the modified JSON back to XML.
- **Dropbox**: Uploads the final XML file to Dropbox.

## High-Level Process Flow
- Fetch XML data from a URL
- Convert XML to JSON
- Modify JSON fields as needed
- Convert JSON back to XML
- Upload XML file to Dropbox

## Detailed Process Description
1. **HTTP Request** node downloads the XML data from a URL (e.g., https://httpbin.org/xml).
2. **XML (To JSON)** node parses the XML into JSON format.
3. **Set** node changes the `slideshow.title` field within the JSON.
4. **XML (To XML)** node converts the updated JSON back into XML.
5. **Dropbox** node uploads the final XML file to Dropbox at the specified path.

## Additional Notes
- Requires Dropbox credentials configured in n8n.
- The workflow can be adapted to modify other XML fields or process different data sources.
- Useful for automating XML data ingestion, transformation, and storage workflows.
