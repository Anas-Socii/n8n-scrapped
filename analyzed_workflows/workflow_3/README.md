# workflow_3

## Summary
Automates the process of retrieving an image from a URL, editing it by overlaying custom text, and responding to webhook requests with the resulting image file.

## Description
This workflow listens for incoming webhook requests, fetches an image from a specified URL, overlays dynamic text (e.g., a name from the request), and returns the edited image as a file response. It demonstrates image processing and dynamic content generation in n8n.

## Input Triggers
- Webhook (receives HTTP requests with query parameters)

## Output
- Edited image file returned as the response to the webhook request

## Nodes Involved
- **Webhook**: Receives incoming HTTP requests and extracts query parameters.
- **Read File URL**: Downloads an image from a provided URL.
- **Edit Image**: Adds dynamic text to the downloaded image (e.g., overlays a name).

## High-Level Process Flow
1. Webhook node receives an HTTP request with query parameters (e.g., name).
2. Read File URL node downloads an image from a static URL.
3. Edit Image node overlays text (from the query) onto the downloaded image.
4. The edited image is returned as the file response to the webhook.

## Detailed Process Description
1. **Webhook**: Listens for incoming requests and extracts parameters for image editing.
2. **Read File URL**: Fetches the image to be edited.
3. **Edit Image**: Processes the image by overlaying the specified text.
4. **Workflow returns**: The edited image as the HTTP response.

## Additional Notes
- No credentials required for the default image URL, but can be extended for authenticated sources.
- Can be extended to support more image operations or dynamic sources.
- Useful for quick image personalization or meme generation APIs.
