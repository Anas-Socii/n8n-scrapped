## Summary
This workflow listens for messages from an MQTT queue and can be extended to process, log, or forward those messages as needed.

## Description

## Input Triggers
- MQTT Trigger (listens for messages on a specified MQTT topic)

## Output
- No direct output is defined. The workflow can be extended to process or forward messages as needed.

## Nodes Involved

## High-Level Process Flow
- Wait for a message on the MQTT topic
- (Extendable) Process, log, or forward the message as needed

## Detailed Process Description
1. **MQTT Trigger:**
    - Listens for messages on the specified MQTT topic.
    - Uses MQTT credentials to connect to the broker.
    - Triggers the workflow in n8n when a message is received.
2. *(No additional nodes present in this workflow)*

## Additional Notes
- Requires valid MQTT broker credentials.
- Ensure the topic and broker details are configured correctly in the node.
- Extend the workflow by adding nodes to process messages, notify stakeholders, or store data.
