# DSP Certificate w/ Google Forms

## Summary
Automates certificate issuance or management by monitoring Google Forms responses via Google Sheets, enabling streamlined digital certificate workflows for DSP.

## Description
This workflow listens for new Google Forms responses submitted to a specific Google Sheet. When a new row is added (indicating a new form submission), the workflow is triggered to process the dataâ€”potentially issuing certificates, updating records, or sending notifications. It is designed for educational or training environments where digital certificates need to be generated and tracked automatically.

## Input Triggers
- **Google Sheets Trigger**: Fires when a new row is added to the 'Form Responses 1' sheet linked to a Google Form.

## Output
- (Not shown in snippet) Typically, this would be a certificate issuance, notification, or entry in another system. Actual output depends on downstream nodes.

## Nodes Involved
- **Google Sheets Trigger**: Watches for new Google Forms responses (row added event).

## High-Level Process Flow
1. Google Sheets Trigger monitors the response sheet for new entries.
2. When a new row is detected, the workflow is triggered.
3. (Downstream steps not shown) Data is processed for certificate generation, notification, or record update.

## Detailed Process Description
1. **Google Sheets Trigger**: Configured to poll every minute for new rows in the 'Form Responses 1' sheet. When a new response is detected, the workflow begins processing.
2. **Downstream Processing**: (Not shown in snippet) Typically, the data from the new row would be used to generate a certificate, update a database, or send an email notification.

## Additional Notes
- Requires Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials.
- Sheet and document IDs must be set in the trigger node.
- Extendable to include certificate generation, email notifications, or integration with other systems.
- Ensure proper permissions for the Google account used.
