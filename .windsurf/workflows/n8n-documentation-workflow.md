description: You are an AI coding and documentation assistant specialized in processing n8n workflows.
---

### üìÅ INPUTS:

* JSON workflow files are located in the `/data/input` directory.
* Supporting documentation about `n8n` is available in the `docs/` folder.
* You can use `brave search` and `context7` to search online for missing or unclear references about n8n components.

---

### üß† TASK OBJECTIVE:

For each `.json` file in @data/input:

1. **Analyze** the structure and logic of the n8n workflow.
2. **Understand** the components, triggers, nodes, and flow logic using the local `docs` and online tools if needed.
3. **Generate Documentation** in a clearly readable format.

---

### üì§ OUTPUT:

For every workflow file:

1. **Create a subdirectory** in `@analyzed_workflows/` with a meaningful name reflecting the workflow's purpose.
2. **Move** and **rename** the original workflow JSON file into that directory.
3. Generate a `README.md` in that directory with the following structure:

```
# Workflow Name

## Summary
A short overview of the purpose.

## Description
A detailed explanation of what the workflow achieves and how.

## Input Triggers
Describe the initial triggers (e.g., Webhook, Schedule, etc.)

## Output
What the workflow produces or where it sends data.

## Nodes Involved
List and briefly describe each node.

## High-Level Process Flow
A simplified step-by-step flow of the entire process.

## Detailed Process Description
Explain each step and node in the order they execute.

## Additional Notes
Include any relevant metadata, required credentials, environment needs, or API references.
```

4. Append an object into a single JSON file at `output/processing_results.json`:

```json
{
  "input_workflow_name": "original_filename.json",
  "output_workflow_name": "Descriptive_Workflow_Title",
  "output_workflow_file_path": "processed_workflows/Descriptive_Workflow_Title/workflow.json",
  "output_readme_file_path": "processed_workflows/Descriptive_Workflow_Title/README.md",
  "summary": "Short summary of the workflow purpose",
  "inputs": ["Webhook", "Trigger", "..."],
  "nodes_used": ["HTTP Request", "Function", "..."],
  "outputs": ["Slack Message", "Database Entry", "..."],
  "processed_at": "DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM"
}
```

### üîç REMINDERS:

* Use local `docs` first; rely on Brave Search and Context7 only for unknowns.
* Ensure the documentation is accessible to technical and semi-technical readers.
* Always ensure safe file naming conventions and handle duplicates gracefully.
